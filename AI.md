# AI-Assisted Development Record
This project was developed using a traditional hand-coding approach.  
Generative AI tools were used selectively to assist productivity, but not to replace manual implementation.

---
## Tools Used
- ChatGPT

---
## How AI Was Used
### 1. Code Review and Refactoring
- Review class structure (Task hierarchy, Parser design)
- Suggest refactoring opportunities to reduce duplication
- Improve method decomposition
All suggestions were manually evaluated before integration.

---
### 2. Date and Time Handling (Level-8)
- Proper use of `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime`
- Formatting with `DateTimeFormatter`
- Identifying edge cases for invalid input
Implementation and validation were done manually.

---
### 3. Testing
- Brainstorm possible edge cases
- Suggest initial JUnit test structures
All tests were verified, and adjusted manually.

---
### 4. Documentation
- Improving JavaDoc clarity
- Identifying missing documentation
Final documentation was reviewed to comply with project coding standards.

---
## Reflection
AI tools improved productivity mainly in:
- Understanding unfamiliar APIs
- Generating test case ideas
- Refactoring repetitive code
AI was less helpful for:
- Debugging logical errors
- Designing overall architecture
